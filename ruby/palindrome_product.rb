# A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.

# Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.

# ex:  932 * 944 = 98889

# test products of large three digit numbers. 
# if they are a palindrome (if num = num.reverse ) return the number 

# start num_one at 999
# start num_two at 998 


# multiply 999 with every number from 998 to 900. 

# put all palindromes into an array. 
# return largest palindrome 

# if there are no palindromes and num_two equals 900
#   subtract num_one by 1 and redo loop. 

#   if both equal 900 by the end of the loop and still no palindromes, set num one to 900 and num_two to 899 and repeat.
